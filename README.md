# CAP6618 Machine Learning for Computer Vision Spring 2019

Most of this work is based on our textbook, [_Hands-on machine learning wiht scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) (author's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)). Highly recommended.

## Module 3

MNIST digit classification without using neural networks.

Using classifiers from scikit-learn, except for `MLPClassifier`.

## Module 4

MNIST digit classification using denseley-connected neural networks, but not deep learning (e.g. CNNs).

## Module 5

MNIST digit classification using CNNs.

## Module 6

Transfer learning and feature extraction with CNNs, including pre-trained CNN models.

## Module 7

More transfer learning, this time experimenting with differen dataset on a pretrained Inception V3 network.

## Module 8 TensorFlow.js

Learning TensorFlow.js in preparation for the class project. The goal is to understand how to use machine learning in a constrained environment (the browser, as opposed to having access to the entire computer's environment).
