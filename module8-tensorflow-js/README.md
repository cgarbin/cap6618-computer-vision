# Learning TensorFlow.js

This folder contains the work to understand TensorFlow.js.

Folders names `tfjs-tutorial-...` are some of the [official tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials).

## Installing and running

All tutorials are configured to run with Node.js and npm.

We will run all examples locally, including the TensorFlow.js library itself.
To do that we need to install the modules locally.

-   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   Install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to act as a local web server (with auto-reload)
-   `cd` to the tutorial directory
-   Run `npm install` to install the modules listed in `package.json`, which
    includes the TensorFlow.js modules we need.
-   Run `live-server` to open a browser and load `index.html`
