# TensorFlow.js handwritten digit recognition tutorial

This folder has a full working version of TensorFlow.js
[transfer learn for images tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-teachablemachine-codelab/index.html#0).

**NOTE**: to make this example work, the `img` that loads the image in
`index.html` had to be enhanced with `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`. Otherwise
the imgur returns a 403 error.
