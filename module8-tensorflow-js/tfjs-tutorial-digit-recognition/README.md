Optional: if you plan to modify and play with the code, install `live-server`
to automatically reload the browser window when the code is changed.

1. `npm install -g live-server`
1. Run `live-server` to open `index.html` on a browser (may need to open a new
   terminal window to make `live-server` part of the path)
1. Modify the code - it will be automtically reloaded
